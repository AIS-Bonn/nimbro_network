	  This launch file runs a sender node, which sends topics from the local

	  By default, this launch file sends topics to your local machine for
	  testing purposes. If you want to send to another machine, use
	    roslaunch nimbro_topic_transport sender.launch target:=other_host
	  where other_host can be a host name or IP address.

	  See udp_receiver.launch for the receiving part.
