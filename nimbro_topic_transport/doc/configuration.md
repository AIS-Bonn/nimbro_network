Configuration
=============

`nimbro_topic_transport` is configured through ROS parameters.

Receiver parameters
-------------------

`tcp_receiver` and `udp_receiver` accept the following parameters:

Required:
 - `port` (int): UDP/TCP port to bind to (required)

Optional:
 - `drop_repeated_msgs` (bool): If a message with the same sequence number
   arrives twice, drop it. Needed in conjunction with the relay mode.
   (UDP only, default true)
 - `fec` (bool): Enable Forward Error correction (UDP only, default false)
 - `keep_compressed` (bool): Do not uncompress compressed topics, instead
   publish them as the type `nimbro_topic_transport/CompressedMsg`
   (default false)
 - `label` (string): Display a label in the visualization GUIs
 - `topic_prefix` (string): prepend topic_prefix before advertised topic names
 - `warn_drop_incomplete` (bool): Display a warning every time an incomplete
   packet is dropped (UDP only, default true)

Sender parameters
-----------------

`tcp_sender` and `udp_sender` accept the following parameters:

Required:
 - `destination_addr` (string): Hostname or IP address of the destination
   machine (required)
 - `destination_port` (int): Port number to connect to (required)
 - `source_port` (int): Source port to bind to. If not specified, the port is
   chosen by the OS (TODO: true for udp_sender!)
 - `topics` (list): List of topics to be transmitted (see below)

Optional:
 - `fec` (float): If non-zero, this is the proportion of repair packets sent for
   Forward Error Correction (0.5 -> Send 50% more data). This needs support for
   FEC compiled in, see README.md (default 0.0)
 - `label` (string): Display a label in the visualization GUIs
 - `relay_mode` (bool): Enable relay mode, see README.md
   (UDP only, default false)
 - `relay_target_bitrate` (float): Target bitrate for relay mode (UDP only)
 - `relay_control_rate` (float): Check if new packets can be sent in relay mode
   at this rate (UDP only)

Topic configuration
-------------------

Configuration of topics to be transmitted is done on the parameter server of
the sender's side. See the example launch files for the usual setup.

Here is a list of parameters that are available per topic. The only mandatory
parameter is `name`.

 - `name`: Name of the topic to be sent over.
 - `rate`: Rate limit on messages / sec (floating point). Messages over the
   rate limit are silently dropped on the sender side. The default is 0.0
   (no rate limit).
   Note: Limiting only works well for lower rates (<20 Hz).
   (UDP only)
 - `resend`: If the sender does not get a message 1.0/`rate` after the last one,
   it will re-send the last received one. (UDP only)
 - `compress`: If true, compress the data on the wire with bz2.
 - `latch` (bool): This topic should be latched. If you want it to work correctly 
    (even when the receiver is started later than the sender), you have to launch the
    helper nodes (look in the example launch files).
